## Gameplay Mechanics
### Bug Discovery System


#### The world seems normal at first, but breaking it requires experimenting with interactions.
Examples:
Jumping while pausing might let you freeze mid-air.
Picking up an object while crouching might clip you through walls.
Dropping an item and reloading at the same time could duplicate it.
Physics & Logic Manipulation


#### Objects have unexpected behaviors when used incorrectly.
Example exploits:
Stacking objects in a specific way might launch you across the map.
Swapping weapons rapidly might cause an infinite damage attack.
Glitch Progression


Instead of unlocking traditional abilities, you learn to manipulate the gameâ€™s broken mechanics.
Some levels require finding a bug to proceed (e.g., clipping through a locked door).
